## General
this branch is created and will be update along the way to describe how the cleaning steps are done through the project.
## cleaning steps: 
* Read the two datasets.
* Concatenation of the train and test data, deletion of unsignificant columns like id.
* Change information encoding the dataset(one hot encoding for categorial varaibles).
* * Depending on the used algorithm, maybe some columns should be coded differently ? a question.
## Brainstorming:  
I want to use pandas for reading csv files, getting first insights and cleaning the data.
